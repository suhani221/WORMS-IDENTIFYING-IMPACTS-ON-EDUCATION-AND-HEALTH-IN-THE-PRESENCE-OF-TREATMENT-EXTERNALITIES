# WORMS-IDENTIFYING-IMPACTS-ON-EDUCATION-AND-HEALTH-IN-THE-PRESENCE-OF-TREATMENT-


In 1998, a group of schools in Africa participated in a deworming treatment program using the medication Albendazole to treat parasitic nematode infections in their pupils. Volunteers from the NGO organizing the program visited the schools unannounced to track attendance as a measure of "school participation" in the study. In addition, academic skills were tested in both 1996 and 1998, allowing for comparison between the two time periods. The problem being studied is the effect of the deworming treatment on school participation and academic performance in these African schools.

In this project with the help of python and its libraries we show how treatment affected school-participation and academic-performance.
